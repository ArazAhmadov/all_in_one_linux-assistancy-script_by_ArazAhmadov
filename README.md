Hey folks,

System administration always requires technical knowledge, attention, and productivity. Writing lengthy commands, remembering them correctly, and coordinating various operations has always been a challenging process. To overcome these difficulties, I’ve created a script called the “Linux Assistancy Tool”! 🎉

Why this tool? 

This tool is designed to save some time for professionals working with Linux operating systems and simplify their workflows. With this toolt, there is no need to memorize every operation - all the essential tasks are gathered in a single menu!

Key Features of the Script: 

✅ 60 Core Functions: The script collects the most needed commands for Linux system administration in a single place. You can easily execute commands via the menu:

Checking and changing hostname
Monitoring kernel parameters and system CPU information
Analyzing RAM and disk capacity
Details of network interfaces
List of active services and users
Network traffic analysis, checking open ports
Firewall management (enable/disable)
Detecting large files during operations and analyzing CPU performance
Basic user and group management commands
Disk health monitoring and LVM details
Custom commands: Rebooting the system, starting/stopping services, changing file and folder permissions, etc.

What’s the goal? 

The main goal of writing this script is to increase productivity in system administration tasks and make them easier through automation. Every operation is designed thoughtfully, so both experienced and beginner users can perform tasks without difficulties.

How to use it? 

Once you run the script in the terminal, a menu will appear. By selecting each desired number off the menu, you can easily perform the desired operation. For example:

Want to change the hostname? Select option 2.
Want to check CPU and system information? Select option 4.
Need to check network traffic and your open ports? Select options 13 and 20.
Each function works for you without the need to type the necessary command when the need arises! 🎯

Advantages: 

🔹 No need to memorize commands;
🔹 Simplifies complex and long commands;
🔹 A simple menu interface is suitable and understandable for everyone;
🔹 It increases productivity and minimizes errors in system administration.

So,the mentioned tool will be an indispensable tool for system administrators. You can now manage all the main system parameters with just a few clicks, without wasting time typing long commands. Save time on Linux operating systems and make your work more efficient! 🚀

Have fun :)
